**Rafala** is a fully decentralized protocol for multichain USDC payments and future privacy-compliant DeFi identity.  
It is composed of multiple permissionless apps built around trustless interoperability, quantum-resistant cryptography, and zkPrivacy — all while keeping the door open for regulatory compliance.

## 🔱 Rafala Subdomains

| Subdomain             | Purpose |
|-----------------------|---------|
| `pay.rafala.xyz`      | Multichain USDC merchant payments (via CCTP V2) with zkPrivacy and optional compliance fallback |
| `app.rafala.xyz`      | Future Rafala DeFi interface, staking, DAO, token interactions, yield modules |
| `identity.rafala.xyz` | Rafala ZK Identity layer (planned), interoperable with Lit Protocol, Semaphore, or Sismo |

## 🚀 What is Rafala?

**Rafala** is a protocol designed to power **private, cross-chain, quantum-resilient USDC payments** and future DeFi identity.  
Our architecture avoids all centralized databases or backends. Every interaction is cryptographically signed, privacy-enabled, and verifiable on decentralized rails.

We are building this protocol as part of the **Circle Multichain USDC Hackathon**, but with long-term vision and real-world adoption in mind.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Multichain Payments**: Powered by Circle CCTP V2 across supported chains (Arbitrum, Base, Linea, etc.)
- 🛡 **zkProof Support**: Protect sender identity with zero-knowledge proofs (via Semaphore or Noir)
- 🔐 **Quantum-Safe Ready**: Dilithium-signed proofs and metadata to ensure resistance to future quantum attacks
- 🌍 **Decentralized**: No database, no backend — just smart clients, wallets, IPFS and smart contracts
- ⚖️ **Compliance-Aware Privacy**: Emergency MPC or Lit Protocol access paths for auditability (opt-in)
- 💡 **Composable**: Rafala is modular and designed to power future identity and DAO modules
- 🛠 **Built for Developers**: Clean structure, verifiable logic, no vendor lock-in
